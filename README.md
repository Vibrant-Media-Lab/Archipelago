## 1. Background

*Archipelago: The B.O.A.T. Expansion* is a self contained expansion pack for *Archipelago*, designed and produced as part of a project for Spring 2019 Post Digital Gaming at the University of Pittsburgh. It centers around seafaring and naval combat, and greatly expands the scope of the main game beyond just islands. In *The B.O.A.T Expansion*, players take the roles of a ship's crew, travelling between different islands and strengthening their dominance of the oceans surrounding the Archipelago. The expansion introduces a number of new gameplay elements, such as major vehicles and vehicle combat, while still fitting into the larger system of *Archipelago* gameplay.

## 2. What's Included

This repository contains all the game boards, pieces, and rules you need to play *Archipelago: The B.O.A.T. Expansion*. In it, you will find folders containing 3D models for each piece in the expansion, designs for all bot specific cards, and both condensed and verbose rulesets. Models are provided in Standard Tessalated Language (`.stl`) format, compatible with most all 3D printers. Cards are provided as `.png` files, and documentation is `.docx` and `.pdf` formatted. You can find these files in their respective directories

## 3. Setting Up

To make the game pieces for this expansion, navigate to the `Easy-Setup` folder. Included there are five files:

	- `easySetup_boat.stl`
	- `easySetup_mast.stl`
	- `easySetup_smallAssets.stl`
	- `easySetup_cards.png`
	- `Setup.pdf`
	
Each of the first three files can be directly loaded into slicing softwre to be printed (Note: models have been scaled down to condense filespace. You may need to manually resize before printing). The fourth can be printed normally, and contains all cards in the proper quantities for play.

After printing the boat, mast, and small assets, you can begin assembly. Fit the mast into the appropriate hole on deck, and place the wheel and its stand in their appropriate place. Attach the fifteen movement spaces to the deck based on the layout in `Setup.pdf`, with the ladder between the main and aft decks. The remaining small assets (i.e. cannonballs, treasure) can be distributed by the Game Master based on the game they design.
